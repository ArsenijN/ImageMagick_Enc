English version:
A small program that is written in Batch and allows you to easily convert photos while saving all possible EXIF metadata.

This project is open source, you can modify it and use parts of it in your projects. I try to leave comments on how the code works, but they can be written in Ukrainian if there is a new function in the code, so **don't delay**
