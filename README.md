# ImageMagick_Enc
ArsenijN ImageMagick converter is a small visual shell with flexible options.
This small program is written in Batch and allows you to easily convert photos while preserving all possible EXIF metadata.

***How does it work?***
The installation file contains the program itself and does not contain a version of ImageMagick. [**Official ImageMagick website**](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)


This project is open source, you can modify it and use parts of it in your projects. I try to leave comments on how the code works, but they can be written in Ukrainian if there is a new function in the code, so **don't delay**
